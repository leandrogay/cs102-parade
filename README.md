## About The Project
### Introduction
Welcome to G2T4's Java-based recreation of the popular card game Parade. In this game, players take turns adding cards to a parade line, with the goal of minimising the number of cards they collect. The game is set in a whimsical Wonderland where players aim to avoid accumulating points by strategically playing cards to remove others from the parade.

Our project uses Java programming to simulate the game's logic, allowing users to experience the fun and strategic depth of Parade in a digital environment. This README will guide you through how to set up, play, and contribute to our version of the game.
